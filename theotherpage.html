Hello Kelly\n
  This is an idea list for things we can do.<br />
  1) Procedural generation for terrain with neural nets<br />
  2) Unity Machine Learning contest? <br />
  https://connect.unity.com/challenges/ml-agents-1?_ga=2.186579945.1790793713.1514149492-1129105289.1514149492<br />
  3) Puzzles of our own invention<br />
  4) Making a game using unity<br />
  5) Making neat 3d models of things programatically, avatars, trees, desks similar to 1)<br />
  6) I thought it would be cool to try to make an algorithm that guesses at good recipes, Generative Algorithm type stuff<br />
  7) Make our own deep style transfer? While this wouldn't be new to us, it'd still be kind of cool cus we could learn alot<br />
  from the in-depth tutorials that exist.<br />
  8) Sorry for all these neural net ideas, we could also try to make algorithms for algorithmic trading on quantopian website.<br />
  9) If you are interested in any NLP stuff we could use Reddit's API to classify sub-reddits based on the content of posts.<br />
      So like maybe you wanna know if r/TruckDrivers has nice people in it. You use bag-of-words or some statistic type stuff to see if they say nice things<br />
  10) Any OTHER idea you might have?!?!?!? Let's do something fun.<br />
  MERRY christmas Ho ho ho!<br />
