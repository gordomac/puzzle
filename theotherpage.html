Hello Kelly
  This is an idea list for things we can do.
  1) Procedural generation for terrain with neural nets
  2) Unity Machine Learning contest? 
  https://connect.unity.com/challenges/ml-agents-1?_ga=2.186579945.1790793713.1514149492-1129105289.1514149492
  3) Puzzles of our own invention
  4) Making a game using unity
  5) Making neat 3d models of things programatically, avatars, trees, desks similar to 1)
  6) I thought it would be cool to try to make an algorithm that guesses at good recipes, Generative Algorithm type stuff
  7) Make our own deep style transfer? While this wouldn't be new to us, it'd still be kind of cool cus we could learn alot 
  from the in-depth tutorials that exist.
  8) Sorry for all these neural net ideas, we could also try to make algorithms for algorithmic trading on quantopian website.
  9) If you are interested in any NLP stuff we could use Reddit's API to classify sub-reddits based on the content of posts.
      So like maybe you wanna know if r/TruckDrivers has nice people in it. You use bag-of-words or some statistic type stuff to see if they say nice things
  10) Any OTHER idea you might have?!?!?!? Let's do something fun.
  MERRY christmas Ho ho ho!
